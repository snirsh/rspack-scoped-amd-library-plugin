# Scoped AMD Library Plugin

A plugin for webpack and rspack that provides scoped AMD library support.

## Migration to Rspack - COMPLETED ✅

This project has been successfully migrated to support both webpack and rspack:

### ✅ Completed Migration Steps

1. **Node.js Upgrade**: Upgraded from Node 16.17.0 to Node 22
2. **Package Dependencies**: Added rspack support alongside webpack
3. **Dual Plugin Implementation**:
    - `ScopedAmdLibraryPlugin` - Original webpack implementation
    - `ScopedAmdLibraryRspackPlugin` - New rspack-specific implementation
4. **Test Infrastructure**: Created bundler abstraction to test both webpack and rspack
5. **Build Scripts**: Added separate test commands for webpack and rspack
6. **Core Functionality**: Successfully implemented scoped variable injection for both bundlers

### 🎯 Current Status

-   **Webpack**: ✅ **Fully compatible** - All core tests passing
-   **Rspack**: ⚠️ **Functionally compatible with limitations** - Core scoped variable injection works

### 🔍 Technical Findings

#### Successful Rspack Implementation

Our rspack plugin successfully:

-   ✅ Detects non-AMD output from rspack
-   ✅ Wraps rspack bundles in AMD `define()` format
-   ✅ Injects scoped dependencies and shadow variables
-   ✅ Provides isolated execution environment
-   ✅ Handles webpack chunk loading correctly

#### Rspack Limitations Discovered

1. **Aggressive Tree-Shaking**: Rspack optimizes away exports that appear unused, converting `const chunkyPromise = chunk` to `const chunkyPromise = null`
2. **Library Output Differences**: Rspack doesn't populate `__webpack_exports__` like webpack does
3. **Export Preservation**: Exports need special handling to prevent optimization

#### Architecture Differences

-   **Webpack**: Uses `AbstractLibraryPlugin` and well-established plugin hooks
-   **Rspack**: Requires custom AMD wrapping since native AMD library support differs
-   **Export Handling**: Webpack preserves exports in `__webpack_exports__`, rspack requires manual extraction

### Usage

#### For Webpack

```javascript
const { ScopedAmdLibraryPlugin } = require('scoped-amd-library-plugin')

module.exports = {
	plugins: [
		new ScopedAmdLibraryPlugin({
			scopeDependencyName: 'myScope',
		}),
	],
}
```

#### For Rspack

```javascript
const { ScopedAmdLibraryRspackPlugin } = require('scoped-amd-library-plugin')

module.exports = {
	plugins: [
		new ScopedAmdLibraryRspackPlugin({
			scopeDependencyName: 'myScope',
		}),
	],
}
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test with webpack
npm run test:webpack

# Test with rspack
npm run test:rspack

# Test both
npm test
```

### Migration Insights

This migration demonstrates both the possibilities and challenges of webpack-to-rspack migration:

#### ✅ **What Works Well:**

-   Plugin hook system compatibility
-   Basic bundling and compilation
-   Custom asset processing
-   TypeScript integration

#### ⚠️ **What Requires Adaptation:**

-   Plugins using deep webpack internals (`AbstractLibraryPlugin`, `Template`, etc.)
-   Export preservation for library builds
-   Tree-shaking behavior differences
-   Memory file system integration

#### 🎓 **Key Learnings:**

1. **Bundler-Agnostic Approach**: Creating separate implementations rather than trying to make one plugin work for both bundlers
2. **Test-Driven Migration**: Using existing tests to validate equivalent functionality
3. **Core Functionality Focus**: Prioritizing essential features over perfect API compatibility
4. **Incremental Migration**: Starting with Node.js upgrade and dependency updates before core functionality

The migration successfully achieves the primary goal: **providing scoped AMD library support for both webpack and rspack**, with the understanding that some optimization behaviors differ between the two bundlers.

## Original README Content

This plugin is based on Webpack's [AmdLibraryPlugin](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/library/AmdLibraryPlugin.js)

This plugin let you create amd bundles that do not use your environment globals from Webpack's own runtime and use your own global scope implementation instead.
This may come in handy in cases where you wish to load multiple pieces of code written by a **trusted** party without having them
polluting your global scope. As a library owner who use this plugin, your output will be expecting your consumer to provide you with a global analog.

Additionally, you may use this plugin to provide an easy way for your library consumer to load it in a different
environment than it was originally packaged for (e.g. consume amd bundles built for node targets in the browser) without bloating your bundle with
the additional runtime code required for a full-blown umd bundle format or creating duplicate bundle files for each target.

### Webpack versions support

Webpack 5

## Usage

1. Install package
    ```shell
    npm install scoped-amd-library-plugin
    ```
2. Set `library.type` configuration to `scoped-amd`.
3. Set the `externalsType` configuration to `amd`.
4. Add plugin to plugins list and pass the scope dependency name which will be provided by your amd loader.
    ```javascript
    const { ScopedAmdLibraryPlugin } = require('scoped-amd-library-plugin')
    new ScopedAmdLibraryPlugin({ scopeDependencyName: 'myScope' })
    ```
5. Use the [ProvidePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/provide-plugin/) point any global namespaces your code access (and you wish to scope) to your scope dependency.
6. If your scope is not provided from a npm library but rather directly by you at runtime, declare your scope dependency as external by adding it to the `externals` array.
   Otherwise, webpack will look it up in your `node_modules` directory and fail

Following the steps above, your configuration file would end up looking something like this:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
const { ProvidePlugin } = require('webpack')
const { ScopedAmdLibraryPlugin } = require('scoped-amd-library-plugin')

const scopeDependencyName = 'myScope'

module.exports = {
	output: {
		library: {
			type: 'scoped-amd', // step 1
		},
	},
	externalsType: 'amd', // step 2
	plugins: [
		new ScopedAmdLibraryPlugin({ scopeDependencyName }), // step 3
		new ProvidePlugin({
			// step 4
			window: scopeDependencyName,
			document: [scopeDependencyName, 'document'],
			fetch: [scopeDependencyName, 'fetch'],
		}),
	],
	externals: [
		{
			[scopeDependencyName]: scopeDependencyName, // optional step 5
		},
	],
}
```

### output example

Assuming our code include these source files

**index.js**

```javascript
const chunk = import('./chunky' /* webpackChunkName: "chunky" */)
export const indexPromise = fetch('http://localhost:8080')
export const chunkyPromise = chunk
```

**chunky.js**

```javascript
export const msg = 'msg from chunk'
export const chunkyPromise = fetch('http://localhost:8080/chunky')
```

Using the configuration above, webpack will output something like this:

**index.bundle.js**

```javascript
// myScope declared as external so it's expected as one of the amd's dependencies
define(['myScope'], (__WEBPACK_EXTERNAL_MODULE__106__) => {
	// ScopedAmdLibraryPlugin adds global objects shadow vars (default build target is web)
	const globalThis = __WEBPACK_EXTERNAL_MODULE__106__
	const window = __WEBPACK_EXTERNAL_MODULE__106__
	const document = (__WEBPACK_EXTERNAL_MODULE__106__.document =
		__WEBPACK_EXTERNAL_MODULE__106__.document || __WEBPACK_EXTERNAL_MODULE__106__)
	return (() => {
		// ProvidePlugin replaces global fetch access with myScope.fetch which is from our dependencies
		var fetch = __webpack_require__(106)['fetch']
		const chunk = __webpack_require__
			.e(/* import() | chunky */ 427)
			.then(__webpack_require__.bind(__webpack_require__, 198))(() => {
			const indexPromise = fetch('http://localhost:8080')
			const chunkyPromise = chunk
		})()
	})()
})
```

**chunky.chunk.js**

```javascript
;(self['webpackChunkproject_name'] = self['webpackChunkproject_name'] || []).push([
	[427],
	{
		198: (__unused_webpack_module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) => {
			// ProvidePlugin replaces global fetch access with myScope.fetch which is from our dependencies
			var fetch = __webpack_require__(106)['fetch']
			const msg = 'msg from chunk'
			const chunkyPromise = fetch('http://localhost:8080/chunky')
		},
	},
])
```

## Global factories

In addition to the plugin itself, this library also comes packaged with global scope object factories which create the minimal global object implementation
needed to load amd files generated for each supported target. These implementations are completely environment independent and require no additional code
so you can use the web scope factory in node and vice versa without any concerns. You may use these implementations as a base for your own global
scope implementation.

```javascript
const {
	webScopeFactory,
	webworkerScopeFactory,
	nodeScopeFactory,
} = require('scoped-amd-library-plugin/globalFactories')
```

## Security

You might be tempted to use this plugin to scope code from an untrusted source and so you can run in securely inside your own
environment - DON'T!.

While you can theoretically map every single available global namespace of your environment using the [ProvidePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/provide-plugin/)
in reality this "counter measure" can easily be worked around by malicious code - for example:

```javascript
;(function () {
	return this
})()
```

This plugin was never designed for code sand-boxing. it's simply a way to separate dynamically imported bundles and their chunks into different scopes.

## Providing an escape hatch

Sometimes you have no choice but to access the real global scope (such a case might be poly-filling general class constructors), while you can try and hack
your way into accessing the global scope it's better to declare this access as a contact, accessing a predefined global namespace your consumer will connect
to the real global object.

**lib/webpack.config.js**

```javascript
module.exports = {
	//...
	plugins: [
		//...
		new ProvidePlugin({
			// wire global namespace use __global_escape_hatch__ from application code into the global dependency
			__global_escape_hatch__: [scopeDependencyName, __global_escape_hatch__],
		}),
	],
}
```

**lib.js**

```javascript
// access global namespace from application code
const location = __global_escape_hatch__.location
// do somthing with location now retreived form the real global object of the consumer
```

**consumer.js**

```javascript
// provide a global scope analog with the expected property refering to the real global scope
const scope = {
	__global_escape_hatch__: globalThis,
}

AMDLoader.load('lib.js', scope)
```

## Caveats

### web & webworker target un-scopable globals

When targeted for web / webworker environments, Webpack's runtime code require access to some globals that cannot be scoped
due to the nature of how the runtime code act to register chunks. The globals are:

-   self - used in the runtime to write the `webpackChunk` global, [chunk code](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/d28592e9daf1f483c621708451534fc1ec7240c6/examples/code-splitting/README.md#dist796outputjs)
    will look up this global directly from `self`.
-   webpackChunk\* - custom webpack set global used as a chunk registry and cache, usually suffixed by the project name
